"For our studio project we are creating a adventure game. we will be using pygame to complete this project. This project will have visual elements.
It will be based on a character named Pavitra Prabhakar. In this game at every point Pavitra will be given a choice and whatever 
he chooses will decide his fate in the game. This adventure game will be taking place in the Amazon forest. 
Here are some must have features of the game:

1. The goal of Pavitra is to find an ancient artifact which is residing inside an ancient temple deep inside a forest
2. The game will have a health bar which will change based on his choices if his health hits 0 he loses the game but if it is above 0 till the last challenge then he wins.

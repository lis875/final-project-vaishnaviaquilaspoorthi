For our studio project we are creating a adventure game. we will be using html, css and javascript to complete this project. This project will have visual elements.
It will be based on a character named Pavitra Prabhakar. In this game at every point Pavitra will be given a choice and whatever 
he chooses will decide his fate in the game. This adventure game will be taking place in the Amazon forest. 
Here are some must have features of the game:
1. At the start of the game, pavitra will be given a choice to choose an item from four items that he will carry with him in his bag. This item is going to be helpfull.
for him during his adventure. These choices will be displayed as cards from what he'll choose the item.
2. The goal of Pavitra is to find an ancient artifact which is reciding inside an ancient temple on top of a hill.
3. This game is to be completed before the sun sets. So the game should have a timer which will be visualised as if a sun is rising and eventually is leading towards getting set as the time passes.
